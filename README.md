# Weather App

### [This app is Live! Try it out](https://weather-app-0121.netlify.app/)


## Tech Stack

- React.js, Typescript
- `@emotion/styled` for styling (no design library is used)
- `@apollo/client` to manage GraphQL queries.
- [amCharts weather icons](https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/) - I used this icons set because not all weather conditions are covered by the provided design.

## Features Covered

- Main functionality.
- User can change temperature units (metrics, imperial, kelvin).
- Refresh data every 5 minutes.

*Didn't have the time to cover the features.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`
